At Kennesaw State University, there are many interest points available for visitors or students to view, interact with, or take pictures around.
Most viewers are unaware of the origin story behind each piece or where each piece is locate relative to their current location. With our app,
we hope to give more publicity to these interest points that define our campus and give a story to our surroundings.

Our app will include functionalities for app members to suggest a new interest point or one we may not have considered. This allows the app
to have intractability aside from using the map itself.

We were excited to take this project on because we want to have the ability to make an application with a real-world purpose to allow
ourselves to be more involved with our campus.
